	\item [2.1.1] Let $E \subseteq (M,d)$ a metric space, and define $E^C = M \setminus E$. \\
		$(\Rightarrow)$ Assume $E$ is open.
		Let $x$ be a limit point of $E^C$, then either $x \in E$ or $x \in E^C$.
		If $x \in E$, then there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \subseteq E$ since $E$ is open.
		But $B_r(x) \cap E^C = \emptyset$.
		Thus $x \in E^C$.
		Therefore $E^C$ contains all of its limit points and therefore is closed. \\
		$(\Leftarrow)$ Assume $E^C$ is closed.
		Let $x \in E$.
		Since $E^C$ is closed, there must be an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \cap E^C = \emptyset$.
		(Otherwise, if no such $r$ exists, then $x$ would be a limit point of $E^C$ that is not in $E^C$.)
		Thus $B_r(x) \subseteq \left(E^C\right)^C = E$.
		Therefore $E$ is open.
	
	\item [2.1.2] We will use the equivalence given in Exercise 2.1.1 for parts (b) and (d).
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item Assume $\{E_\alpha\}$ is a collection of open sets.
			Let $x \in \bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha$.
			Then $x \in E_\alpha$ for some $\alpha$.
			Thus there exists an $r > 0$ such that $B_r(x) \subseteq E_\alpha \subseteq \bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha$.
			Therefore $\bigcup_\alpha E_\alpha$ is open.
		\item Assume $\{F_\alpha\}$ is a collection of closed sets.
			Then $\{F_\alpha^C\}$ is a collection of open sets.
			Thus (by part (a)) $\bigcup_\alpha F_\alpha^C$ is open, which means its complement is closed.
			Thus $\left(\bigcup_\alpha F_\alpha^C\right)^C = \bigcap_\alpha F_\alpha$ is closed.
		\item Assume $\{E_i\}_{i=1}^N$ is a finite collection of open sets.
			Let $x \in \bigcap_{i=1}^N E_i$.
			Then $x \in E_i$ for all $i$, which means there exists $r_i$ such that $B_{r_i}(x) \subseteq E_i$ for all $i$.
			Set $r = \min{r_i}$.
			Then $B_r(x) \subseteq B_{r_i}(x) \subseteq E_i$ for all $i$.
			Thus $B_r(x) \subseteq \bigcap_{i=1}^N E_i$.
			Therefore $\bigcap_{i=1}^N E_i$ is open.
		\item Assume $\{F_i\}_{i=1}^N$ is a finite collection of closed sets.
			Then $\{F_i^C\}$ is a finite collection of open sets.
			Thus (by part (c)), $\bigcap_{i=1}^N F_i^C$ is open, which means its complement is closed.
			Therefore $\left(\bigcap_{i=1}^N F_i^C\right)^C = \bigcup_{i=1}^N F_i$ is closed.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item [2.1.3] The collection $\{(-1,1/n) : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is a collection of open sets, but
		$$ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left(-1,\frac{1}{n}\right) = (-1,0] $$
		which is not an open set. \\
		The collection $\{[0,1-1/n] : n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ is a collection of closed sets, but
		$$ \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty \left[0,1-\frac{1}{n}\right] = [0,1) $$
		which is not a closed set.
