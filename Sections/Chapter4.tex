	\item [4.1.1] This is a simple exercise of showing that the norm of each of these functions is $1$ and the inner product between any two distinct is zero.
		Since the Lebesgue and Riemann integrals are equal for functions that are integrable in both theories, we calculate the Riemann integrals.
		\begin{equation*} \begin{split}
			\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\right)^2 dx &= 1 \\
		\end{split} \end{equation*}
