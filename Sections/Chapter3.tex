	\item [3.1.1] Suppose $\mathcal{B}$ is countable.
		Then enumerate the elements according to the one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$.
		\begin{equation*} \begin{split}
			a_1 & = \{a_{11},a_{12},a_{13},\dots\} \\
			a_2 & = \{a_{21},a_{22},a_{23},\dots\} \\
			a_3 & = \{a_{31},a_{32},a_{33},\dots\}
		\end{split} \end{equation*}
		Define a new sequence in $b \in \mathcal{B}$ as
		\begin{equation*} b_n = \begin{cases}
			1 & \text{if } a_{nn} = 0 \\
			0 & \text{if } a_{nn} = 1
		\end{cases} \end{equation*}
		But then $b$ cannot be represented in the enumeration above.
		Thus $\mathcal{B}$ cannot be countable.
	
	\item  [3.1.2] $\mathcal{B}_T$ is countable because each member $\{a_i\} \in \mathcal{B}_T$ can be identified with a terminating series
		$$ \{a_i\} \to \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{a_i}{2^i} $$
		which means each element of $\mathcal{B}_T$ is identified with a unique rational.
		Thus $\mathcal{B}_T$ is in one-to-one correspondence with a subset of $\mathbb{Q}$. \\
		Now, each number $r \in (0,1)$ can be written as a non-terminating binary expansion
		$$ r = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{a_i}{2^i} \quad\text{where } a_i \in \{0,1\} $$
		Then these $\{a_i\}$ represent the members of $\mathcal{B}\setminus\mathcal{B}_T$ (because they are non-terminating).
		Thus $\mathcal{B}\setminus\mathcal{B}_T$ is uncountable which means $\mathcal{B}$ is also uncountable.
